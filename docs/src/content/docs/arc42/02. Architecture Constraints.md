<!-- Architecture Constraints
========================

**Contents.**

Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of
design and implementation decisions or decision about the development
process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and
are valid for whole organizations and companies.

**Motivation.**

Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design
decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must
always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

**Form.**

Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can
subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political
constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines,
documentation or naming conventions) -->

| Constraint | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Deadline   | The project must be completed by the end of the semester. |
| Budget     | All developers have other classes to attend, this can't take too much of their time away |
| Programming Language | The project must be implemented in Rust. |
| Documentation | The project must be documented well. |
| Testing | The project must be tested well. |
| Every developers must have a good understanding of the project | The project must be implemented in a way that every developer can understand it for the final exam. |
