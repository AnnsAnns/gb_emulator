<!-- Risks and Technical Debts 
=========================

**Contents.**

A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by
priority

**Motivation.**

“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister,
Atlantic Systems Guild.)

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of
risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by
management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part
of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

**Form.**

List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested
measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts. -->


## Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation | Likelihood |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Team member leaves | A key team member leaves the project | Knowledge transfer | Low |
| Technology risk | The selected technology is not mature enough | Proof of concept | Medium |
| Not fulfilling quality goals | The architecture does not fulfill the quality goals | Regular reviews | High |
| Deadline risk | The project deadline is not met | Regular monitoring | Medium |
| Unequal distribution of knowledge | Knowledge is not shared equally among team members | Pair programming | Low | 
| Crunch | The project is not completed in time | Regular monitoring | High |
