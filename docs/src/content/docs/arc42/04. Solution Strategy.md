<!-- Solution Strategy
=================

**Contents.**

A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and
solution strategies, that shape the system’s architecture. These include

-   technology decisions

-   decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g.
    usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern

-   decisions on how to achieve key quality goals

-   relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development
    process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

**Motivation.**

These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are
the basis for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

**Form.**

Keep the explanation of these key decisions short.

Motivate what you have decided and why you decided that way, based upon
your problem statement, the quality goals and key constraints. Refer to
details in the following sections. -->

## Decisions

### Bevy as the UI Engine

We decided to use Bevy as the UI engine for the game. Bevy is a game engine built in Rust that is designed to be fast and easy to use. It is a new engine that is still in development, but it should serve our more simple needs well.

### u8 Array instead of BytesMut

Using a static array of `u8` instead of a `BytesMut` for the memory buffer in the game. This is because the buffer will always be a fixed size and we don't need the extra functionality that `BytesMut` provides.

Given that the GB did not support Threading we don't have to worry about the potential problems that could arise, it's highly unlikely that we will ever have two concurrent writes unless the UI is doing something it shouldn't be.

## num_enum for easier syntax

We decided to use the `num_enum` crate to make it easier to work with enums that have a numerical value. This allows to write easy to read code when accessing hardware registers.
