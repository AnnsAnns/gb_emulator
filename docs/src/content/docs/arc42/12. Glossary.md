Glossary 
========

**Contents.**

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

**Motivation.**

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

**Form.**

A table with columns &lt;Term&gt; and &lt;Definition&gt;.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

| Term                              | Definition                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Term 1                            | &lt;definition-1&gt;              |
| Term 2                            | &lt;definition-2&gt;              |
